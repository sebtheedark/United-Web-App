https://sebtheedark.github.io/United-Web-App/

**Was tasked with developing an inventory storage log of all the vehciles that come in through our system. 
**

**Version 1: 
**
- So far functionallity wise, a very barebones form was created that only takes a total of 6 arguments. 
- Form data is stored locally on the users browser until page is refreshed. (Planning to store to a DB and not locally) 
- Need to still develop function to total up the fees and update daily.
